3. **View Fresh Jobs**: `https://your-app.railway.app/api/fresh`

## ðŸŽ¯ What Happens After Deploy

### Immediate (Within 5 minutes):
- âœ… Site goes live on Railway domain
- âœ… 58+ existing jobs available immediately
- âœ… All pages working (jobs, privacy, contact, etc.)
- âœ… Admin login functional

## ðŸ“Š Monitor Your Deployment

### API Endpoints to Check:
```bash
# Scraping statistics
GET https://your-app.railway.app/api/scraping/stats

# Fresh jobs (combines scraped + API)
GET https://your-app.railway.app/api/fresh?limit=20

# Manual scraping trigger
POST https://your-app.railway.app/api/scrape-now

# All scraped jobs
GET https://your-app.railway.app/api/scraped-jobs
```

### Success Metrics:
- ðŸ“ˆ **Job count increasing** every 2 hours
- ðŸŽ¯ **4 sources active**: LinkedIn, Indeed, ZipRecruiter, Google Jobs
- ðŸ“… **Recent jobs only** (last 30 days)
- ðŸŽ“ **Entry-level focused** for college students

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### If No Jobs Appear:
1. Check environment variable: `ENABLE_AUTO_SCRAPING=true`
2. View logs in Railway dashboard
