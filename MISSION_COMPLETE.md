# ðŸŽ‰ Automated Job Scraping System - COMPLETE!

## âœ… What's Been Built

Your job site now has a **comprehensive automated job scraping system** that continuously finds fresh entry-level and college student positions from multiple sources:

### ðŸŽ¯ Sources Integrated
- **Indeed**: Corporate entry-level positions
- **LinkedIn**: Professional network opportunities  
- **ZipRecruiter**: Diverse job marketplace
- **Google Jobs**: Aggregated listings

### ðŸ”„ Automation Features
- **Every 2 hours**: Quick scrape for new postings
- **Daily at 6 AM**: Comprehensive scrape across all sources
- **Smart filtering**: Entry-level, college, graduate, intern positions
- **Duplicate removal**: No duplicate jobs displayed
- **Auto-cleanup**: Removes jobs older than 30 days

### ðŸ›  System Components Created

#### 1. Job Scraper (`services/jobScraper.js`)
- Multi-source scraping with rate limiting
- Entry-level job filtering by keywords
- Company diversity (no single company dominance)
- Error handling and retry logic

#### 2. Job Scheduler (`services/jobScheduler.js`) 
- Cron-based automation (every 2 hours)
- Manual scraping triggers
- Statistics tracking
- Background processing

#### 3. API Routes (`routes/scraped-jobs.js`)
- `GET /api/fresh` - Combined scraped + API jobs
- `GET /api/scraped-jobs` - Scraped jobs only
- `POST /api/scrape-now` - Manual trigger
- `GET /api/scraping/stats` - Statistics

#### 4. Frontend Integration (`Public/jobs.html`)
- Updated to use fresh scraped jobs
- Shows job source statistics
- Fallback to Indeed API if needed
- Enhanced job display with company details
